All of the sudden, standing up, their chunk right in the screen. Still figured out a way to get fired. It was unreal. It\u2019s kind of good, though, that those creeps got to take a break, \u2019cause I felt like cancel culture, they were kind of running out of people to cancel. You know? As much as they wanted to make it seem, there really was a finite amount of people that took their dick out at work.

Yeah. So fortunately they rounded up all of these fuckin\u2019 animals\u2026 and they got rid of them, right?

You know, the initial thing, you agree with it, and then it kind of gets out of control. So, I don\u2019t know. But it kind of ran out of people and there was this hilarious moment, like last year where they started to try and cancel dead people. Remember that? All of the sudden, out of nowhere, John Wayne was trending. Have they got some found footage, a new movie coming out that maybe they shelved? Then all of the sudden it was all these stupid-ass \u201cwoke\u201d white people, right? \u201cOh, my God, did you see what John Wayne said in Playboy in 1971?\u201d Can you\u2026 this is a bunch of fuckin\u2019 white people all up in arms about a dead white guy. \u201cI can no longer tolerate this.\u201d \u201cI can no longer tolerate dead-for-45-years John Wayne saying things in a magazine that doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d \u201cI am here for Black people.\u201d"}

Yes, it\u2019s a crazy statement in 2021. 1976, you know, it\u2019s not good, but it\u2019s not crazy. Right? And he\u2019s born in 1930. You gotta put this shit in historical perspective. I love old movies. You ever watch movies from the \u201930s, \u201940s, and \u201950s? Yeah. Any time a woman even has heightened emotion, there\u2019s some guy like, \u201cGet ahold of yourself!\u201d \u201cYeah, go make me a pie. Put it on the windowsill.\u201d Right? That\u2019s what he grew up watchin\u2019. I grew up in the \u201970s. I thought being a truck driver was a cool thing. You know, you had a monkey for a friend. Going around, chicks are showin\u2019 their titties. I thought that that was the world. I had no idea, that\u2019s what I was watching. My thing is, okay, so if you\u2019re gonna cancel all of these fuckin\u2019 dead guys and shit all over them after they\u2019re dead and they can\u2019t defend themselves, why are you only going after men? You know, what about all the horrible women in history? You can\u2019t just go after the men, that would be sexist, and this is what they don\u2019t want. You know? I mean, what about Coco Chanel? Great example. Coco Chanel. Widely considered a feminist icon. She started her own purse factory, right, in the 19-teens or \u201920s, whatever the hell she did. I can\u2019t imagine the sexism that she had to deal with, you know. An amazing accomplishment, hats off to her, right? However, she was also a Nazi sympathizer. Yeah. That\u2019s like half her fucking Wikipedia page, just sitting there, waiting for someone to read it. Right out in the open, nothin\u2019. So evidently, what happened was, in World War II, old Adolf came rolling into town, okay, with his tanks with the Porsche engines in \u2019em, took over the town in like 90 minutes. She freaked out. She closes up her shop, right? Figured out where all the head Nazis were staying, what hotel. She moved in there and she started a relationship with one of the Nazis. Yeah. She started fucking a Nazi. You ever see those Holocaust videos? Huh? With those piles of kids\u2019 shoes? Yeah. She was sucking the dick that did that. Now, just to refresh my memory, what did Sean Connery do again? \u201cOh, you know, every once in a while, you give \u2019em a little slap.\u201d That\u2019s what he did. She\u2019s sittin\u2019 there like, \u201cHey, Adolf, what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d She so sold out her own country, she had to flee it at the end of the war, and I have no idea how many dicks she had to suck to get back in it. But despite all of that, I still don\u2019t judge her. I don\u2019t, \u2019cause I\u2019ve never been in that situation. You know, I\u2019ve never been in a country where all of the sudden, the most powerful army the world has ever seen comes in and takes it over in a couple of hours. She must have been terrified, right? And she\u2019s a woman. You know? She\u2019s into fashion. They show up with those Hugo Boss uniforms. You know, her knees buckle a little bit. Things start getting ugly, people are getting shot in the street. She\u2019s freakin\u2019 out. You know. And she\u2019s a woman, and women know push comes to shove when you get your back against the wall. No matter how bad it gets, they always have the option of fucking their way out of a situation. They always got that card they can play. Right? All women know this. Women, all women know this. Men don\u2019t realize this till they go to prison. But women learn this early on. She had the option and she took it. I can\u2019t get mad at her for that, you know? So she\u2019s dead and gone. I think she\u2019s up there in heaven. I think she made it. She\u2019s up there with Sean Connery. Every once in a while, they have a disagreement, he gives her a little slap, you know? She doesn\u2019t care. Once you shit on a Nazi\u2019s chest, a little backhand\u2019s not gonna freak you out. Jesus can\u2019t say anything, he got a hooker, right? Everybody\u2019s got a little something they did. Well, there you go, boom. Still buy your Coco Chanel. She\u2019s still a hero. She was a victim, she was a victim of that time. She was frightened, she was scared. She didn\u2019t know what to do. Uh\u2026 anyway. So, we\u2019re living in a fucking weird time. Obviously, beyond all the bullshit that\u2019s going on now, like, every time I think feminism has kind of like died off, you know, you know, like a band you can\u2019t stand and they haven\u2019t put out an album in a few years, you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, good, did they quit, did they break up?\u201d All of the sudden, they come out with more shit. You\u2019re like, \u201cFuck, what is it now?\u201d I\u2019m just fucking with you. Feminism doesn\u2019t bug me, you know? It doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m not afraid of it or anything like that, you know, for the simple fact that I know it\u2019s gonna fail, you know? And I take comfort in that, I do. I\u2019m not rooting for it because\u2026 I know it doesn\u2019t like me. Um\u2026 Yeah, do you know why I think it\u2019s not going to survive, why it\u2019s not going to be successful anyway? \u2018Cause they still need men\u2019s help to make it happen. I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t understand why women just can\u2019t work with each other and make this shit happen. They keep coming to us, like, \u201cMore men need to care about this issue.\u201d \u201cWhere are the men to stand up and say something\u2026 yak-yak-yak.\u201d Why do I have to fuckin\u2019 say something?

I need to write jokes. I gotta put a lampshade on my head. I know what my role is, okay? I should be on the ground gazing up at people better-looking than me. I don\u2019t know, ladies, this is supposed to be like an inspirational talk. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s coming through this way. I\u2019m trying to say, if you really like\u2026 If you get through all the misdirected anger of my childhood\u2026 I\u2019m trying to say, you\u2019re smarter than we are and there\u2019s more of you. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I\u2019m trying to be\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Trying to be a better person during all of this shit, you know? I am. You know, I got this new thing, man. I try to help out homeless people. You know? Sometimes I help them out, sometimes I don\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s like the mood you\u2019re in, how much they freak you out. You know? So, this is what I do. You got to do something because people at the top don\u2019t seem to be doing anything. I try to bring all my old clothes down to the tent cities to give it to them. It\u2019s a good thing to do, but I gotta tell you something, you gotta do it during the day. All right? You want to do it during the day when they\u2019re tired from Thunderdome the night before, they\u2019re coming down from whatever they\u2019re on, realizing there\u2019s a nail in their shoulder. You want to get them when they\u2019re tired. You don\u2019t go at night. No one\u2019s gonna see you again, you\u2019re gonna end up on a fuckin\u2019 spit. I mean, you\u2019re under an overpass, you never know what can happen, okay? I\u2019m just warning you \u2019cause they don\u2019t make homeless people the way they made them when I was a kid, you know? When I was a kid, a homeless guy was a bum, he was a vagrant, somebody down on his luck or whatever. You know, a wino. They didn\u2019t have this Shutter Island shit going on that they had out there, like people talking to trees. [shouting gibberish] You\u2019re right here having, like, eggs Benedict. He\u2019s, like, looking through a porthole over your cabbage. Yeah. When I was a kid, you could only be crazy outside for about 15 minutes before a van would pull up and two guys in nurses\u2019 outfits would just come walking out. \u201cHey, buddy, how\u2019s it going?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re making a lot of racket out here, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do me a favor, try this shirt on?\u201d Be like, \u201cOkay. How come the sleeves are so long?\u201d \u201cOh, because we\u2019re gonna tie your arms behind your back \u2019cause you\u2019re out of your fucking mind, that\u2019s it.\u201d \u201cNot gonna have you out here scaring the shit out of people.\u201d \u201cGet in the fuckin\u2019 van!\u201d And he got in the van and that was it. They send you to a nuthouse. That\u2019s it, boom, bam, done, nuthouse. But the problem was the people at the nuthouses started fucking the patients \u2019cause everybody knows crazy people are great in bed, right? So they\u2019re banging away, right? Hey, it happened. You\u2019re groaning at history, all right? You can shake your heads all you want, but\u2026 Hey, hey! They fucked those people, all right? And they were banging away, doctors with their fuckin\u2019 lab coats flappin\u2019 in the wind, just banging away, until finally\u2026 for decades\u2026 finally somebody with a heart came walking in, \u201cHey, what the fuck is going on here?\u201d And then they shut it down and then they just let all these people go. They all came running out like Mike Myers, jumping up on station wagons and shit. So that\u2019s the thing, you go during the day. And I gotta tell you, when I pull up to one of these tent cities, I always feel good about myself. \u201cThis is good, man, helping out a fellow American.\u201d \u201cI would want them to do that for me.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fuckin\u2019 ridiculous people have to live like that.\u201d That\u2019s what I think when I\u2019m in the car, and then the second I get out and that smell hits me, I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat the fuck am I doing? Jesus Christ, these people are animals!\u201d Right? I would equate it to the same feeling you probably get if you were on a safari and you\u2019re in the Land Rover, and you look over and you see, like, a leopard. You\u2019re like, \u201cLook at that leopard over there.\u201d Right? Then all of the sudden you go over a bump and fall out of the fuckin\u2019 Range Rover. \u201cOh, fuck, that\u2019s a leopard!\u201d Yeah, so I pull up and I\u2019m feeling like fuckin\u2019 Uncle Sam. Then I get out of the car and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat the fuck am I doing?\u201d I start walking like this. There\u2019s always some sort of movement going on, somebody fuckin\u2019 limping across the street or something. And I\u2019ve never been able to get close enough to talk, really, to anybody. You know, like they do on the news. You know, like, \u201cJeez, have you been sitting in here, you know, for a couple of months?\u201d \u201cWhat is it like to be inside of this tent?\u201d I always wondered how many people they had to choke out before they could get that fuckin\u2019 interview. You know, just comin\u2019 in\u2026 blow darts. Numbin\u2019 up everybody else. Building a perimeter. So, what I\u2026 What I do is I get about 30 yards away, and then I just start walking like this. And then I chicken out, I always chicken out. Thirty yards away, I just go, \u201cFree shirts!\u201d I run back to the car. And that\u2019s when your brain starts playing tricks on you. Like I\u2019m convinced somebody just came running out of the tent with a 2-by-4. Running after me. So I always do a lap around my car before I get in it, you know. \u2018Cause homeless people have horrible lateral movement. You know, from all those years of sleeping on the sidewalk, their hips are just junk, you know, like an NFL running back. They slow down like a cruise ship, go right up and over the horizon. So in that time, you go around, you get in your car, you drive away. You drive away. Your closet\u2019s a little more empty. You can go out, you can fill it back up again with shit you don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 need, you know, that\u2019s what you do."}

You just do. Something happens where you just look at the side of their head and just do the math and just think, \u201cWhy did I ever talk to you?\u201d \u201cI could have just walked by. I didn\u2019t even have to say hello.\u201d \u201cWe had no relationship.\u201d \u201cWe were nothing!\u201d \u201cWhat would happen if I just never talked to you?\u201d Every six weeks, you think that\u2019s a healthy relationship?

So I was like, \u201cFuck, I need to pull the rip cord.\u201d \u201cI gotta get out of this fuckin\u2019\u2026 it\u2019s like a giant beanbag.\u201d Couldn\u2019t get out of it, right?

And I still felt that feeling. And I was like, \u201cAll right, what the fuck is this?\u201d \u2018Cause I know that\u2019s bullshit. And I just sort of laid there. And I relaxed. And I went, \u201cOh, fuck, I know what this is.\u201d This is how I felt growing up. [chuckles] Yeah. This is what the \u201970s and \u201980s were like. Both your parents worked.

You just were fuckin\u2019\u2026 Yeah, like I love seeing kids nowadays loving their dad. Like, \u201cDad, wanna go play, Dad? Let\u2019s go ride bikes!

Teachers would grab you, dig their nails into your fuckin\u2019 neck. She\u2019d come home, \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have done that unless something happened.\u201d Right? It was all of that shit. Me and my siblings, we all beat the shit out of each other. You know. And then we all teased the dog, and the dog bit all of us. And we never got rid of the dog. One time the dog bit me in the face. I was fuckin\u2019 with it, it was eating, I was like\u2026 And he latched onto my face like\u2026 Like that. My dad had to stitch me up and everything. We still didn\u2019t get rid of the dog, you know? \u201cAw, he\u2019s a good dog, he had a moment.\u201d \u201cJesus Christ, you shouldn\u2019t have put your goddamn face down there near the fuckin\u2019 dog.\u201d Yeah. So that\u2019s all it was. It was weird, we were like The Brady Bunch meets Lord of the Flies. Like, on paper, it was great. It was a station wagon full of fuckin\u2019, you know\u2026 Norman Rockwell, we went to church, we got Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. Yeah, that was about the fuck\u2026 so\u2026 I don\u2019t know, so anyway, we all ended up\u2026 My dad was one of those people, he said whatever the fuck was on his mind. You know what I mean? Yeah. You know, like that haircut women get when they get to a certain age? They got a couple of kids, they just get it cut a little shorter \u2019cause they don\u2019t wanna deal with it. They put that little Hillary Clinton flip in it or something. Right? They get it all shaved up the fuckin\u2019 back. First time you bend \u2019em over, you feel like you\u2019re fuckin\u2019 your friend Eric. Right? You know? But you love your wife, so you lie and you tell them, \u201cOh, looks good.\u201d \u201cLooks great, I always wanted to fuck Geraldine Ferraro.\u201d \u201cMy God, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d My dad didn\u2019t care. We picked my mother up, she got in the car, he just goes, \u201cAw, Christ, it looks like shit!\u201d \u201cJesus Christ, what the fuck did they do to you?\u201d \u201cAw, for Christ\u2019s sake, you look like a fuckin\u2019 man.\u201d My mom\u2019s just sittin\u2019 there like\u2026 We\u2019re in the back seat like, \u201cThis is what a functional relationship looks like.\u201d Whoo! Yeah. So, because of all that, we all ended up getting, like, physical ailments from being in the fight-or-flight mode our whole lives. Everything, gym teachers were scary, collecting on your paper\u2026 Everybody was scary fuckin\u2019 everything. One time my dad told a priest he didn\u2019t deserve to wear the collar. I don\u2019t know how it happened. We were discussing the altar boys\u2019 schedule\u2026 and, I don\u2019t know, he wanted to put me on a different mass, and my dad started getting his leg going. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to wear the fucking collar!\u201d The guy\u2019s jaw was on the ground, and then the best part, next week we go to mass. They haven\u2019t spoken in a week, and my dad comes walkin\u2019 like, \u201cHey, how you doin\u2019, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Like nothing happened. Yeah, so anyway, we all end up getting these physical ailments. Like one of my siblings has stomach problems, another one has this pain that won\u2019t go away in his back. I remember I had, like, alopecia in, like, the third grade. Third grade, I literally had clumps of hair falling out like I was working on Wall Street, you know. And I was just sitting there like, \u201cDid I pick up all the toys?\u201d \u201cDid I do the dishes?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s gonna find something, he always finds something.\u201d \u201cFuck, what do I do?

I don\u2019t yell at my kids, but what I do is\u2026 what I still do is I flip out. So, like I said, I didn\u2019t think that this was a problem. My wife told me it was a problem, but I don\u2019t listen to her, you know. Why would I listen to her? All she does is criticize, you know? I got nothing but bad reviews on the fuckin\u2019 Husband Yelp. It\u2019s just all, \u201cYou know, didn\u2019t enjoy the experience.\u201d \u201cThumbs down, half a star,\u201d never get a fuckin\u2019 \u201cattaboy,\u201d right?

Oh, yeah, you again, okay, great.\u201d \u201cGreat, what did I do this time, huh?\u201d \u201cWhat do I have to work on?\u201d \u201cGo ahead, fuckin\u2019 let me know,\u201d right?

I was still fuckin\u2019 mad. So I said, \u201cWho gives a shit? I don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d Lied to myself, said I didn\u2019t give a fuck, you know? So then I ended up going home. Then I\u2019m washing the dishes, which is a very Zen-like thing to do. It\u2019s a week later, you wash dishes, you\u2019re not thinking of anything. Your brain is empty, I\u2019m washing the dishes, and then all of the sudden, the answer just came to me. It just floated into my head, and I just looked up. I was like, \u201cOh, my God. I know why she did it.\u201d I know why she bumped into me. She bumped into me because she\u2019s a lesbian. It was right there. I was, like, looking nine miles down the street, looking under shrubs. It was right in front of my face. She did it because she\u2019s a lesbian. All right, so judging by most of your silence, I will do this math for you, come on. Let\u2019s have a little empathy here. Put yourself in a lesbian\u2019s shoes, all right? Who do lesbians date? Women. Who do they move in with? Women. Who do they get in relationships with? Women. Who do they eventually marry? Women. And I was thinking like, \u201cOh, my God. I did that.\u201d I know what the fuck that\u2019s like. I know what it\u2019s like to live with one of those fuckin\u2019 things. I know exactly what that\u2026 it\u2019s hopeless. Trying to make them happy. \u201cHey, I bought you this shiny thing. Did I do it right, huh?\u201d Trying to get them to take responsibility for their actions. Not gonna happen. The best you\u2019re gonna get is, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2026\u201d I know what it\u2019s like to be winning a fuckin\u2019 argument, you\u2019re winning, and then they turn it around, they\u2019re crying, you\u2019re apologizing. You\u2019re thinking, what the fuck just happened? How am I losing this shit? I had you on the ropes. You feel so dumb, you got to go for a walk. And you\u2019re just thinking, how did I lose again? How did I lose again? And then you figure it out, it makes you feel stupid, and then you see some bald idiot with a giant orange mustache, you\u2019re like, \u201cYou know what, why don\u2019t you take some of that shit?\u201d \u201cYou take some of that fuckin\u2019 anger.\u201d Yeah. I feel so stupid that I got mad at that woman. I shouldn\u2019t have got mad at her, I should have bought her a beer. And just listen to her troubles and had empathy and be like, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. You married a woman, I did it too.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna win. There\u2019s no winning this.\u201d Yeah. I\u2019m telling you, if you don\u2019t believe me, do a little people-watching. Take a look at the look on the average lesbian\u2019s face. I don\u2019t mean a lesbian in her twenties, she\u2019s got her life ahead of her, she\u2019s got Christmas in her eyes, right? I mean, a lesbian about 35, 36, starting to settle in to what the deal\u2019s gonna be, right? And then look across the bar, find a married guy about the same age. Look at the look on his face. Look at the look on her face, go back to his face. It\u2019s the same fuckin\u2019 look. Yeah. And then look at gay guys. Some of the happiest people I\u2019ve ever met in my life. They\u2019re almost too happy. It\u2019s like, \u201cHey, how\u2019s it going?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cHi!\u201d Almost floating across the room with that lack of estrogen just yanking down your fuckin\u2019 dreams. No. Now, look, it might be a front. I\u2019m not saying all gay guys are just blissfully happy, but it\u2019s looking like a pretty good time to me. Dude, they\u2019re some of the most positive people I\u2019ve ever met in my life. Any idea you have, they support it. They\u2019re just like, \u201cYes, yes, queen, yes!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re fierce, you can do it!\u201d Lesbians are up in the bar like a bunch of jaded cops. \u201cIt\u2019s all fuckin\u2019 bullshit.\u201d \u201cWhat the fuck was I thinking?\u201d \u201cU-Hauling after ten days, moving in. What the fuck was I thinking?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s crazy!\u201d No, I\u2019m telling you, I think married men and lesbians need to start hanging out more, and we gotta put our heads together and try to solve our common problem, the women in our lives. So we can somehow attain the perceived happiness of the average gay dude out there. Yeah. So, if you believe in that shit, I\u2019ll give you some advice. If you\u2019re gonna expand your fuckin\u2019 world of friends, I\u2019ll give you some advice. You can\u2019t just hang out with any lesbian. All right? You gotta make sure you\u2019re hanging out with the dude in the relationship, right? And by \u201cdude,\u201d I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s manly, I\u2019m not being ignorant. By \u201cdude,\u201d I just mean she\u2019s the one that gets blamed for most of the shit. Right? \u2018Cause no relationship is balanced. Somebody is getting away with more. Somebody\u2019s drafting behind the other. It\u2019s like a bike race. Somebody else is taking the fuckin\u2019 weather in the face. [imitates fanfare] Right? Somebody else is fuckin\u2019 right behind. \u201cOh, yeah, it really is wet.\u201d Just kind of hiding under your fuckin\u2019 poncho. Male-female, female-female, they-they, whatever the fuck it is you\u2019re into. Every relationship, there\u2019s the person that does the dishes and the person that lets them soak. Right? They don\u2019t let them soak. They know you\u2019re gonna do \u2019em. They\u2019re just waitin\u2019 you out. After a while, you can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 take it anymore. They\u2019re just sitting there. You gotta go start doing them. Then what do they do? They sit in the other room and wait, like they don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, and wait till they hear pots and pans, and that\u2019s when the show starts. That\u2019s when they come running in like, \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI was gonna do those!\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t. They\u2019ve been sitting here eight hours.\u201d \u201cI got my hands in room-temperature water with scrambled eggs floating around.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t gaslight me, you\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 animal.\u201d \u201cYou were raised by animals, get out of my sight.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t yell at me!\u201d Right? Yes. Every relationship has the person that will take the trash bag out of the trash barrel and do a little\u2026 Tie it off and then leave it slumped against the counter. Like it took two behind the ear in a mob hit, just\u2026 And then there\u2019s the person that actually picks it up and takes it out to the curb at night and puts it in the trash can, right? My wife\u2019s hilarious, I love her, but she\u2019s got some of the worst excuses ever. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever take out the trash?\u201d She goes, \u201cI would, I\u2019m just afraid of coyotes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid of the coyotes.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cSo am I! So am I!\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re rabid dogs.\u201d \u201cThey hunt in packs of twos and threes.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t do it \u2019cause you don\u2019t wanna do it \u2019cause you know I\u2019m gonna do it, just get the fuck away from me, please.\u201d I\u2019m telling you\u2026 So, anyway\u2026 I know I said a lot of divisive shit here tonight, so before I get out of here, before I get out of here, I want to\u2026 Let\u2019s bring the room together. It\u2019s a very divisive time. Everyone wants to feel safe. Let\u2019s do a nice, normal, mainstream topic, so everybody can drive home happy, no fights, all right? Sound good? All right, great. Let\u2019s talk abortion. There you go. Everybody has an opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s my body, it\u2019s my right.\u201d \u201cWell, then fuckin\u2019 drive to Arkansas, bitch!\u201d Right? Everybody has an opinion. As do I, and I apologize that you\u2019re gonna have to listen to mine. Because\u2026 I\u2019m gonna tell you right now. I have a really weird take on abortion. I\u2019m gonna tell you that right from the get-go, okay? I\u2019m 100% pro-choice, always have been."}

Who the fuck am I to tell you what to do with your body? So that always made sense. All right? However, I still think you\u2019re killing a baby. See? That\u2019s where it gets weird.

I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a doctor, but I\u2019ll tell you, my gut tells me that doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s not a baby yet. That would be like if I was making a cake and I poured some batter in a pan and I put it in the oven, and then five minutes later you came by and you grabbed the pan, you threw it across the floor. And I went, \u201cWhat the fuck?! You just ruined my birthday cake.\u201d And then you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t a cake yet.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, it would have been.\u201d \u201cIf you didn\u2019t do what you just did, there would have been a cake in 50 minutes.\u201d \u201cSomething happened to that cake, you cake-murdering son of a bitch!\u201d Right? Now, before all you pro-life people get excited, I think it\u2019s great you\u2019re killing your babies. It\u2019s fantastic. Help Mother Nature out. There\u2019s too many of us. It\u2019s been 130 degrees out. Animals are going extinct. There\u2019s plastic in the fuckin\u2019 ocean. We don\u2019t need any more fuckin\u2019 people. And especially, if you\u2019re honest with yourself, have you done anything great with your life? Is the person you\u2019re banging doing anything great? The answer to both of those questions is no, what are the odds you\u2019re gonna make a great person? I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re gonna make a bad person, you\u2019re just gonna make another person that doesn\u2019t go when the light turns green \u2019cause they\u2019re staring at their fuckin\u2019 phone."}

I don\u2019t want to freak you out, all right, because I did that joke when I was down in the BIBLE BELT, and I was down south, and this girl took me really seriously. She came up to me at the end of the show, and she\u2019s like, \u201cyou\u2019re not really thinking about doing something like that, are you? You\u2019re not really\u2026\u201d and I was like, \u201cNo, no, no. I\u2019m just joking. I\u2019m just joking.\u201d She goes, \u201cgood, \u2019cause, you know, you can\u2019t go to heaven if you do something like that.\u201d And I was just like, \u201cyeah, you know, I really don\u2019t give a shit, you know?\u201d It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t.

It\u2019s bizarre. Like, if my girlfriend broke up with me, I\u2019m not gonna lie to you. I would be devastated, devastated. I\u2019d be laying on the ground crying in the fetal position for, like, three days, you know. But, you know, by the fourth day, you know, I\u2019d rub one out, you know, start putting the pieces back together.

And then I come back to my country and it\u2019s like, \u201cThe studio said I have to lose 15 pounds to star in a movie.\u201d Well, then start running, you fat fuck! That\u2019s your big complaint in life? You know what it is about these fatties? Do you know what it really is? They have no respect for the amount of sacrifice and dedication it takes to truly get in, like, magazine-level shape, which is the\u2026 You ever try to get abs? You ever tried to get all the abs down here? You ever tried to do it? It\u2019s fucking impossible! Past the age of 19, you can\u2019t do it without tons of help. You\u2019ve got to buy all these exercise tapes, you\u2019ve got to read about nutrition, you\u2019ve got to get a personal trainer having you fucking running along. You need your own chef. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t eat it yet. All right, now eat it. Start consuming it. All right, stop. Slow down. Stop. Stop. Spit it out! Spit it out! I told you to stop! Get on the elliptical! You liked that Brussels sprout?! Did you like that?! \u2018Cause now you\u2019re paying for it!\u201d It\u2019s a fucking miserable experience. Just walking around and your whole body\u2019s eating yourself. \u201cDo you want some cake?\u201d \u201cNo. No, I\u2019ll just take a salad. Balsamic vinaigrette on the side. No croutons. Oh, my God! When is the photo shoot? I want to kill myself.\u201d It\u2019s horrible. Have you ever tried to get fat? No. You don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s effortless. You can fucking lay on your back, watching your favorite show, just shoveling shit down your throat. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m getting fat. I\u2019m getting fat.\u201d \u201cYou got a trainer?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t need one. It\u2019s natural. I just eat everything that makes my sugar/salt go like, \u2018Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!\u2019 It comes right in, a nice roll of fucking flab.\u201d No, it\u2019s ridiculous. I know nobody wants to be fat, so I\u2019m not shitting on anyone. But don\u2019t fucking come at me like it\u2019s my problem, and I need to fucking rewire myself. No. You\u2019re overweight, okay? There\u2019s plenty of things that can help you out."}

Who the fuck comes here to get in shape?\u201d Whenever I get McDonald\u2019s, I have a whole plan. At my age, I\u2019m 48 years old, I know what I\u2019m gonna order. I\u2019m gonna go in there, it\u2019s gonna taste great. Twenty minutes later, I\u2019m gonna want to kill myself.

And don\u2019t give me that horseshit that eating healthy is expensive. It isn\u2019t. Go to a fucking supermarket. They\u2019re throwing the vegetables at you. \u201cHere\u2019s celery. Get it the fuck out of here! Seventy cents! Twenty-five cents for a banana! Whatever the fuck you want! Get it out of here\u2026 before it goes bad!\u201d No, it\u2019s fucked up.

You could just pull in and hide in plain sight, right? And that little sad traffic jam of divorcees, shut-ins, people who go to Comic-Con, right? You just pull in\u2026 and just stop. You can take a little nap. It\u2019s like\u2026 \u201cThank you! Thank you! Right.\u201d You\u2019d pull around. That\u2019s what it was all about.

We\u2019re doing it, too!\u2019 Your own mother won\u2019t make you pancakes at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, okay? So get your fat ass or your drugged-up ass down here before 10:30.

So\u2026 Anyways, by the time this special comes out, another election will have come and gone, and it\u2019s just\u2026 God knows who we picked. It\u2019s another one, they\u2019re not gonna fucking talk about anything. The oceans are dying. They just said the Great Barrier Reef is dead. You know? Genetically altered food. There\u2019s too many fucking people. I don\u2019t even know\u2026 They\u2019re just talking about a bunch of shit. You know? Bruce has to drop a deuce. Where is he gonna go? Which bathroom should this guy use? I don\u2019t give a shit. This guy has enough money to literally have a porta-potty rickshaw running behind him. How are you going to eliminate\u2026 a couple billion fucking people? Do you ever think about that shit? You know, they never talk to us about it. You know they do behind closed doors. A bunch of creepy dudes all sitting around some giant table. Right? They probably talk about it then. Just sitting down after, like\u2026 \u201cI trust everyone had their fun?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s get down to the task at hand. There are over 7.5 billion people on the planet. We\u2019re running out of fresh water. There won\u2019t be enough chicken\u2026 to feed the others. Does anyone here have any suggestions\u2026 on how to eliminate the pressures of the undesirables?\u201d \u201cAh, yes, you. Number four. You may speak.\u201d \u201cWell, you know, what uh\u2026 What if we, like, slowly cooked \u2019em at the airport? You know? Just throwing it out there. What if you had a revolving-door-looking thing, you made \u2019em take their shoes off, they got in and they stood up like that? And you just radiate \u2019em from head to toe\u2026 once on the way out, once on the way back.\u201d \u201cOh, yes. Yes! I like that. I like the sound of that. And how would that work? Would you have it on low at first, sear them like a tuna steak? They don\u2019t understand. You let the children go. We\u2019ll use them for slaves later, right? No old people. They\u2019ll die soon. Just people in the prime of their life. And gradually, over the years, you increase it and they start frothing at the mouth. They don\u2019t recognize their children. The property comes back to us!\u201d \u201cOh. I trust everyone at this table flies private?\u201d Dude, my wife thinks I\u2019m out of my mind because I think shit like that. But I think I\u2019m right. Dude, I know they think about it. I know they think about it, because I think about it. Every time I land in a city and it\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, I\u2019m just driving down the street and I\u2019m in the middle of a fucking traffic jam, that inner Mussolini comes out of me, right? Like, \u201cWhat are all these people doing in my road?! They must be eliminated!\u201d I don\u2019t know. Like, how do you not fucking bring it up? It\u2019s \u2019cause it would freak everybody out, you know, that you have to start maybe taking some measures\u2026 to start thinning out the herd. Do you feel that? That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right, yeah. And what do you think, dude? You think you\u2019re gonna\u2026 You think you\u2019re in the fucking upper tier? You\u2019re in the\u2026 You\u2019re in the luxury boxes, yeah? You spend a lot of time with yourself. You\u2019re doing a lot of nodding. \u201cI like what I think. I like what I think a lot. What I think is the way it should be.\u201d I understand what that\u2019s like. I live this fucking isolated life, man. I go on the road, I\u2019m in green rooms, and I just fucking, you know\u2026 I\u2019m just by myself all the time. You slowly go fucking crazy. I did a gig recently. I was in Ireland and I was in the green room by myself. I went to turn on the light. It was one of those pull switches. It wound up around itself, looked like a little noose. I immediately thought, \u201cWhat if I stuck my head in there and just\u2026\u201d \u201cand just turn the lights out?\u201d literally and figuratively. I was not thinking about killing myself at all. The second I thought, \u201cWhat if I just fucking did that?\u201d And then I looked in the mirror, I caught my eye and we both laughed. Yeah. I had this wonderful little moment with myself. No words needed to be spoken. You know? Yeah. So I think about the population all the time, as you can tell. On my specials, I\u2019m always talking about it. I think I got the plan, \u2019cause I know\u2026 No. Wait until you hear the plan first, \u2019cause a lot of people are gonna die. Before you start hootin\u2019 and hollerin\u2019. Everybody thinks they\u2019re gonna fucking make it, right? This is how you do it. Well, this is how I would do it. First of all, you\u2019ve got to become a dictator, okay? Because it\u2019s too late to be like, \u201cHey, man, maybe just have a couple\u2026\u201d It\u2019s too fucking late. Someone\u2019s got to have the balls to take out the sickle\u2026 and start chopping some heads. So, here\u2019s my idea. I become dictator. Obviously you\u2019ve got to murder everybody in power, right? From the head all the way down to their goldfish, you\u2019ve got to kill everyone in the family so they don\u2019t come back for their revenge, like in\u00a0Godfather II\u00a0or every karate movie you\u2019ve ever seen, right? You\u2019ve got to do it the way the Russians did, where you don\u2019t find the skulls for 100 fucking years. That\u2019s the way you do it. Then you take control of the media. I keep all of you guys media blacked out. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on unless I want you to know it, right? Big pictures of me. You\u2019ve got to sing songs about me. If there\u2019s no passion in it, a black van pulls up and you\u2019re never seen from again. All right? I figure three to six months of that, everybody gets on the same page, and that\u2019s when I\u2019d start thinning it out. This is how I would do it. I would just start randomly sinking cruise ships. Just hear me out. It\u2019s the way to go. It\u2019s the way to go. You get 2,500 to 3,000 people a whack. And I think it\u2019s a really good mix of people to get rid of. You know? Think about the kinds of people that take a cruise. These aren\u2019t forward thinkers. These aren\u2019t seekers. They\u2019re not pivotal to our survival. You ever hear somebody coming back from a cruise? It\u2019s one of the worst stories you\u2019re ever gonna hear. Because they don\u2019t do shit. They don\u2019t want to travel to another country, interact with a new culture, try to figure out the train system or the money. All they want to do is just sit on a fucking boat. Just drinking. That\u2019s all they want to do. Right? Worst story you\u2019ll ever hear. \u201cHey. How was your cruise?\u201d \u201cOh, it was great. I was fucking laying there. There was a DJ over here on the one-and-the-two wooka-wooka thing. Right? And then they had this chocolate fountain. It was like a fountain, but it was chocolate! And you stuck the toothpick in the food, and you stuck it in the chocolate, and you stuck it in your mouth.\u201d Then, \u2018I want another drink!\u2019 Then they bring it, you drink it, it dribbles down and it gathers in your navel. You punch yourself\u2026 to get it in your mouth.\u201d Then, every day around noon, we line up for lunch. What\u2019s for lunch? We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t make decisions. Whatever they give us. I like all-inclusive, you just have to think once. Can I write that number on this piece of paper? All right, tell me where to go.\u201d I\u2019m telling you, if you guys could just get past the humanity of what I am suggesting\u2026 If you could just get past it and maybe lose a couple of friends here or there\u2026 I am telling you, you wouldn\u2019t miss them. You know when you\u2019d miss \u2019em? When you went to a baseball game and there wasn\u2019t those 100 people in the upper deck trying to get the wave going. Right? You wouldn\u2019t have people getting mad \u2019cause someone\u2019s sitting during a song, like, \u201cThat\u2019s offensive to me, even though I don\u2019t know the issue!\u201d Right? Nashville, a little pull back on that one. A little pull back. It\u2019s about police brutality. It has nothing to do with you and your beautiful white world, and mine, right? Just let it go. I don\u2019t give a fuck if you watched every episode of McHale\u2019s Navy. This is still not about you. It\u2019s not a military issue. I\u2019m telling you, you wouldn\u2019t fucking miss \u2019em. And this is the deal, all right? I wouldn\u2019t just give the order to start sinking these cruise ships and then retire to my chambers with my mistresses and my whores. Right? Just banging away, wearing the whole uniform. The whole dictator uniform. Everything except for the pants. Right? Compression socks with sock garters, just banging away. My honorary medals just clanging off my chest. The big thing is to see how long I could fuck and keep the hat on. Like, \u201cYeah! Yeah! Yeah!\u201d No, you can\u2019t do that. That brings resentment amongst your men. You\u2019ve got to lead them into battle, and I would. I would. I\u2019d have my own sub. All right? I\u2019d have my own sub and I would hunt these cruise ships on a moonlit summer night. That\u2019s right. On a moonlit summer night, when sound carries. You know, those summer nights when your neighbor\u2019s talking about you. He doesn\u2019t think you can hear him. You\u2019re on your porch. \u201cIs that how it is?\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is, right?\u201d One of those nights. And I\u2019d be a sport about it. I\u2019d surface before I did it. I\u2019m armed, they\u2019re not. It\u2019s only fair, right? If they see me, I give them a little wink, a little nod. I\u2019d have a little Red Baron class. \u201cAll right, get the fuck out of here.\u201d Right? But if you didn\u2019t see me, it would be game on. And every moonlit summer night, every summer I would go out to harvest. That would be the deal. I would just surface. \u201cAnd listen for the music, yeah?\u201d \u201cFire one.\u201d \u201cDude, look at my arms in this tank top.\u201d And then you cruise over, you strafe all the survivors. \u201cBring it around!\u201d That would be it. Twenty-five hundred to 3,000 less people. And you know what\u2019s the greatest thing? It\u2019s all underwater. All the evidence is gone. All the evidence is gone. Every mass murderer throughout time has fucked up. They did it on land. You\u2019re gonna get caught. Where are you gonna put all of that, right? You do it out to sea. It all goes under, you know? Nobody knows. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I have no idea.\u201d No evidence. No evidence. Maybe\u2026 Maybe, like, a flip-flop, right? Like an Ed Hardy shirt just\u2026 floating by. I\u2019m controlling the media and nobody knows about it, right? And as I sank the ships, I would be building exact replicas at the same time, right? So I\u2019d be eliminating people while creating jobs."}

Another buddy of mine got a job building ships. Can you fucking believe that? That industry, it\u2019s just blowing up. It\u2019s crazy. Dude, I want to get a job down there. They pay great. You know, make a little extra money. Who knows? Maybe you and me take a cruise. We\u2019d have a good time, right? Get out there.\u201d That\u2019s how it would work. That\u2019s how my ethnic cleansing would work. It wouldn\u2019t be based on race or religion. It would just be based on people dumb enough to think that taking a cruise is actually travelling.

{"text": "So\u2026 Yeah, look, admittedly, I\u2019m a fucking\u00a0psycho. And uh\u2026 Oh, yeah. Dude, I have dreams\u2026 I had a dream two years ago that still haunts me. You know? You ever have one of those dreams where you think you woke up but didn\u2019t? You\u2019re just sitting up and it feels like\u2026 I had one of those dreams, right? So I just sat up in bed, and I looked over, and there was a little girl in the corner. No idea who she was. She was, like, three, four years old. And she was talking to me, but I couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying. She was standing in the corner, going\u2026 I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWhat did you say? I\u2026 I can\u2019t hear you, sweetheart. You\u2019ve got to come closer.\u201d She walked halfway to the bed. She was nodding her head, going\u2026 Big, like, The Grudge eyes. I\u2019m just\u2026 \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come closer.\u201d She walks up to the bed. I was like, \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear you, sweetheart. What did you say?\u201d And she just nods and just goes, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna kill yourself.\u201d I just sat up, like\u2026 I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not! No, I am not!\u201d My wife wakes up. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cI just had the most scary dream I\u2019ve ever had in my life! It was horrible!\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cWas I in it?\u201d \u201cNo, you self-centered jackass! Jesus Christ! Not everything is about you, sweetheart. I love you, but it\u2019s not all about you. Now, shut up. I\u2019m gonna\u2026\u201d I tried to go to sleep in the same position so I\u2019d run into that little girl again, so I could, \u201cLook, you little shit, you don\u2019t go around saying that to people!\u201d Now, I\u2019m not gonna kill myself. I don\u2019t know what that dream meant, because you dream in metaphors, man. You know? I don\u2019t know. It just freaks me out, though, you know? It disturbs my wife and shit. But there is one good thing about being a psycho. You know, a great thing about being a psycho is you can spot another psycho from a mile away. You know? That\u2019s a really great thing. I can spot \u2019em. You know, it\u2019s in the eyes. Never look at the costume. Nice people look at the costume. They\u2019ll see somebody in, like, dad jeans, you know, pushing their kid on the swing, the whole nerdy sweater. \u201cHey! How are you doing? Can you believe the summer\u2019s already over? I mean, this is crazy, right? Oh, this one here has got me running around, you know? She\u2019s running the house! She\u2019s running the house.\u201d People are always like, \u201cOh, my God. He\u2019s so nice. Such a great family man.\u201d And I\u2019m just sitting, thinking in my head, dude, that guy is a fucking psycho! He\u2019s a psycho! Look at his eyes. You don\u2019t see that? That dude is barely hanging on! He is white-knuckling it through all the shit he thinks he\u2019s supposed to do. All that fucking guy needs, all he needs, he just needs a little nudge. That\u2019s it, just a little nudge. You have no idea what that guy\u2019s capable of. I would not want to see the hard drive of that man\u2019s computer, I\u2019m telling you."}
{"text": "Yeah, so I do it all the time. I\u2019m pretty good at picking out psychos, and it drives my wife nuts. I remember she was one of the first people that got into\u00a0Kanye West, right? The great Kanye West. Everybody loves him and stuff, right? Oh, shut up. Jesus Christ. Why did I come to Nashville? \u201cBoo! It\u2019s a black artist! You\u2019re bringing it up in the Ryman. What the fuck? It\u2019s the Grand Ole Opry, man! It\u2019s not MTV Raps!\u201d But I\u2019m stereotyping you. I\u2019m acting like \u2019cause you\u2019re from the South, you\u2019re racists, like all the racists are just down here. That isn\u2019t true. You know, they\u2019re all over the place. It\u2019s just different degrees. Right? Like, me, I\u2019m racist, like, at the end of the day. Like, I\u2019m a great fucking guy, I don\u2019t give a shit who you are in the morning. You\u2019re eating your cereal. \u201cHey! How are you? What\u2019s going on?\u201d But as the sun starts to go down and the fear starts coming up, that\u2019s when you start thinking the worst of people, right? I know, nobody\u2019s gonna be honest. I don\u2019t give a fuck who you are. Twelve, midnight, in a parking garage by yourself, whatever is walking at you, there\u2019s no happy thoughts. You\u2019re not thinking, \u201cOh, that guy, he\u2019s probably uh\u2026 he\u2019s probably building a website and\u2026\u201d You\u2019re not thinking that. That dude\u2019s gonna cut me up, eat me. Whatever he doesn\u2019t eat, he\u2019s gonna fuck. That is what you think, right? All right? But if you do that at night, that\u2019s normal, I think, because it\u2019s fear. It\u2019s the people at breakfast that are already just sitting there, like, \u201cFucking Jews!\u201d You know, that\u2019s when you\u2019ve got an issue. So\u2026 So, anyway\u2026 I\u2019ve just got to do this. When you talk about race and that shit as a white dude, you\u2019ve got to go easy. You know, because very easily it starts feeling like a meeting. You know? Whenever I start hearing, like, \u201cYeah! All right! Whoo!\u201d That\u2019s when I go, \u201cI\u2019ve got to pull back. People aren\u2019t seeing what I\u2019m saying. I wore a country shirt. Things are getting a little off the rails here.\u201d Can I get back to Kanye West? Half of you have probably downloaded his shit. All right? All right, here we go. So, my wife got freaked out because\u2026 Early on, she was loving the guy. And I was thinking he was cool. Then, one day, I saw him do an interview. He was talking shit about how great he was, and there was just this look that was in his eye, and it just made me nervous. I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, this guy is uh\u2026 This guy is, like\u2026 This guy is volatile, man. There\u2019s something with this guy. He\u2019s making me nervous. This guy is, like, right on the edge of, like, snapping, right?\u201d She goes, \u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind.\u201d I was thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think this guy is fucked up.\u201d Then I was convinced, because one day I came walking in, she was listening to him do an interview, and I didn\u2019t know it was him. He was talking about how great he was, and I came walking in, and all I did was hear this shit. And, like, literally, a chill ran down my spine, and I just started thinking, like, \u201cNo! No! No!\u201d And I turned, and I looked. Before it even registered that it was Kanye, my first thought was, \u201cOh, thank God. Oh, thank God. It\u2019s just a black guy.\u201d \u201cThank God! It\u2019s just a black guy.\u201d Yeah, I know, you\u2019re right to pull back. It\u2019s right to get awkward, you don\u2019t know where this could go. This could very easily go in a Klan-ish direction, okay? So just let me clarify. Just hear me out. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cThank God it\u2019s a black guy,\u201d meaning, \u201cThank God that ego that is in him\u2026\u201d When that thing floated down from the heavens, or the cosmos, whatever the hell Joel Osteen shit you believe\u2026 All right? When that thing was floating down, it could have landed in anybody. Thank God\u2026 it landed in a black guy. Thank God it got wrapped up in that, trapped within that. It\u2019s safe in there. No reason to worry when it\u2019s in there, because if that ego, however, had floated down\u2026 and landed in a blue-eyed white dude, there is no telling the damage that could have been done. You\u2019re talking entire civilizations wiped out\u2026 worldwide famine, the moon colliding with the Earth. Thank God that ego landed in a black guy. Because he\u2019s just as nuts as some of the craziest white dudes of all time, he just doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to follow through with the madness. Right? Yeah, there\u2019s a glass ceiling on evil. You never noticed that? Dude, go home, put on the History channel. Like, the top nine out of ten most batshit-crazy dudes who ever walked the earth are all white dudes. Now, why is that? Because white dudes are more evil than anybody else? It\u2019s a possibility. It\u2019s a possibility. We\u2019ve definitely got the numbers. But I think it\u2019s different. You know what it is? Nobody\u2019s watching white dudes. Right? White dudes, too many of \u2019em gather and somebody pulls up, \u201cAll right, break it up! Keep it moving! Get out of here!\u201d Getting pulled over for no fucking reason, none of that shit. You\u2019re a white dude. It\u2019s just an open field. Anything you think, \u201cHey, I\u2019m gonna do that.\u201d No one\u2019s stopping you. You just\u2026 You just start running. Next thing you know, you\u2019re handing out buttons, you\u2019ve got your own uniform. You\u2019re starting a fucking war, right? All Kanye West is allowed to do is fuck up an award show every three to four years. Make a public service announcement a little awkward for Mike Myers. That\u2019s as far as he\u2019s ever gonna get. I know, I know. You don\u2019t believe me. Dude, okay, next time Kanye\u2019s going off on himself, I\u2019m telling you, just close your eyes, forget it\u2019s him and really listen to what is coming out of this guy\u2019s mouth. He says shit like, \u201cI\u2019m a genius.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a god. I\u2019m Shakespeare.\u201d \u201cMy biggest regret is I\u2019ll never get to see myself perform live.\u201d That\u2019s a direct quote. \u201cMy biggest regret is I\u2019ll never get to see myself perform live.\u201d Dude, you put that ego in a white dude, then it\u2019s\u2026 \u201cand the blitzkrieg, and the superior race!\u201d \u201cVienna will return to Deutschland first!\u201d No, I\u2019m telling you. But we\u2019re okay. We\u2019re okay. It\u2019s in a black guy. Nothing\u2019s gonna happen. You never noticed that shit? Crazy black guys, as far as they can get, they can just freak people out in the subway. They can stand on a street corner with their book and their friends, just yelling about white people. \u201cThese people got tails! The motherfuckers got tails! They\u2019re evil!\u201d You just cross the street. That\u2019s it. In a perfect world, Hitler never would have made it past the subway level. That\u2019s as far as he ever would have got. You would have been on the train. \u201cWhat are you gonna do tonight?\u201d \u201cPlay a little fantasy football.\u201d The door would just open. He\u2019d come walking through. \u201cAnd they should have the blue eyes and the blonde hair, and the pubes like the sun!\u201d And you\u2019re just sitting there. \u201cJust ignore him. Let him pass through. Let him pass through.\u201d And he\u2019d just walk into the other part of the train. Literally, a world war just passing through. But he was a white dude, no one watched him and his hair was flopping around, and nobody gave a fuck. All right? So that\u2019s kind of like the weird lesson\u2026 that I learned with Kanye West. You know? Like, every once in a while, racism works. Like, 99.9 per cent of the time, it\u2019s the ugliest thing we do to one another, but every once in a while we get lucky and that marble, it just rolls into the right hole and we get off easy. We got off easy with that guy."}
{"text": "I\u2019ve got to commend you guys. You did well with the\u00a0Hitler\u00a0reference. You did all right. Nothing quiets a room like dropping the H-bomb.

Some think he went down to South America\u2026 \u201cAnd why are they so brown?\u201d for the rest of his life. At this point, even if he lived, he\u2019s fucking dead, right? We can go with that, right? But still, to this day, though, even though he died let\u2019s say 75-fucking-years ago, he\u2019s still the benchmark for evil. Have you ever noticed that? He is the reference. Any time you want to say somebody\u2019s evil, you just say, \u201cHe is the next Hitler.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump, he\u2019s the next Hitler.\u201d \u201cSaddam Hussein, he\u2019s the next Hitler.\u201d It\u2019s always, \u201cHe\u2019s the next Hitler,\u201d okay?

I don\u2019t know what they said. But whatever they used to say, he wiped them all out. He was so fucked up, it\u2019s like what they did didn\u2019t even exist any more. All right? It\u2019s like when Michael Jordan came into the NBA. He was so fucking good\u2026 he wiped out everyone. No one ever goes, \u201cHe\u2019s the next Dr. J.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the next Wilt.\u201d No one says that. It\u2019s always, \u201cHe\u2019s the next Mike.\u201d Right? Adolf Hitler is the Michael Jordan of evil. He is. Like, Nike literally should have made him a sneaker, like a giant fucking boot. You know, it\u2019s all stiff around your knees so you get that walk going down. Right? Like, if there was an evil hall of fame, you\u2019ve got to put Hitler in. He\u2019s first-ballot hall-of-fame evil. Okay? Undeniable stats. He\u2019s got the career numbers. You know? Six to nine million dingers, you\u2019re getting in. You\u2019re getting in. People, its a sports analogy. I\u2019m not advocating what the man did. Can we all be adults here? All right? Am I gonna be on a split screen tomorrow morning with some blogger? On some Good Morning, Nashville show. \u201cComedy: Can it go too far? Last night at the Ryman Theater\u2026\u201d \u201cmaking fun of fat people, sinking cruise ships was all fine. Suddenly, it took a horrible, horrible turn. Fortunately, local blogger Maggie Maggenhall was on the scene. Maggie, can you describe what you were subjected to\u2026 during last night\u2019s horrible rant?\u201d \u201cWell, first of all, everybody that knows me knows I have a great sense of humor. I think this is funny, I think that is funny, but that, last night, that was not funny.\u201d It always goes down like that. They always have to establish what a wonderful sense of humor they have. No, it\u2019s a sports analogy. Okay? Six to nine million. He got all of that one! He had power from both sides of the plate. He\u2019d have his own fucking wing. Okay? But this is what kills me about Hitler. Killed six to nine million people. Meanwhile, Stalin killed 20 to 25 million, basically over the exact same period, okay? Yet, he cannot get arrested in the conversation of most fucked-up dude who ever walked the planet. It\u2019s always, \u201cHe\u2019s the next Hitler. He\u2019s the next Hitler.\u201d Well, how many fucking people do you have to kill just to get a little shout-out, a little tip of the cap? \u201cWhat do you think of this guy?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the next Hitler.\u201d How about, every once in a while, \u201cThis guy\u2019s a little Stalin-esque\u201d? \u201cI see a little Jo-Jo in this guy.\u201d Right? He almost tripled his fucking numbers. He gets brought up like he was a backup! Why don\u2019t his kills count? Does anybody\u2026 Anybody, why doesn\u2019t his fucking kills count? I don\u2019t get it. Is it because he just looked like some regular guy, your neighbor? You know, driving a little John Deere. \u201cI just killed a million Ukrainians.\u201d He just drives around his yard. Is that what it is? I think it is. Hitler just\u2026 I don\u2019t know, he just looked the part. He\u2019s like\u2026 From central casting, you couldn\u2019t pick a more evil-looking dude. Like, go home tonight, google pictures of Adolf Hitler. Get put on the same watch list that I\u2019m on, all right? I\u2019m telling you, there\u2019s not one cute picture of that guy his whole life. It\u2019s just all pure evil. There\u2019s no, like, teenage boy-band years, like\u2026 You google a picture of Adolf as a baby. You look at that thing, you\u2019re like, \u201cDude, drown that fucking thing! Drown it! Take it down to the river, stick it under a rock. If you don\u2019t do it, I\u2019m gonna fucking do it. I swear to God, it\u2019s looking at me. I would kick it right in its baby chest\u2026 and feel no guilt whatsoever.\u201d Dude, Hitler is actually so evil, he actually makes me want to learn how to speak German. You know what I mean? I just want to know, what the fuck was he saying to those people? Every speech. He\u2019s so clearly out of his fucking mind. It\u2019s got to be what he\u2019s saying. What the fuck did he say? There\u2019s no way he said what he planned on doing from the get-go. Some unknown candidate, right, early on\u2026 \u201cOkay, our next speaker coming to the stage\u2026\u201d \u201cto possibly run Deutschland for the foreseeable future. His name is um\u2026 Oh, dear. I left my glasses backstage. Is that Alan? Is it Alan? Oh, Adolf. Adolf, okay. Oh, okay, okay. Whoa. This guy\u2019s got a bee in his bonnet. Okay, please welcome Adolf Hitler. You got three minutes, buddy.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to kill millions of people! I know what they should look like\u2026 The eyeballs a centimeter apart! I have the outfits for the rest of the people!\u201d Dude, you can\u2019t come out of the gates\u2026 talking to a crowd like that. You\u2019re gonna freak \u2019em out. You can\u2019t go that hard in the beginning. You know? You can do that in the woods with a couple of drinking buddies. Freaking people out. \u201cHey, Matt, relax. There\u2019s girls here. Jesus Christ.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019ve got a shot here. I\u2019m trying to get laid. Can you just be a wingman? For once in your life, dude, can you just be a\u2026 Just bring the energy down. Nobody gives a fuck about your fucking theories, okay? Just be a chill guy. You\u2019ve got shit on your mouth. Either grow a moustache or don\u2019t. You look ridiculous. I\u2019m sorry, ladies. He gets a little excited.\u201d What I think he was doing, I think he was just being a crowd-pleasing hack, if I had to guess. He was telling Germans what they wanted to hear. \u201cAnd we have the best cars, we have the best women. Oktoberfest is the shit!\u201d He\u2019s just shooting free T-shirts up. Fucking armbands. Right? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s something that\u2019s always bothered me. Not always, just recently. If this guy kills six to fucking nine, everybody\u2019s\u2026 we definitely don\u2019t want another one of those. Well, what about this guy? Twenty to fucking 25. You know? What it is, there\u2019s probably a couple of egghead history majors going, \u201cWell, Bill, if we\u2019re gonna go around the world, you know, what about that dude Mao from China? He allegedly killed 50-60 million people. What about that guy? How come you don\u2019t bring him up?\u201d Simple. I don\u2019t count those kills. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t count \u2019em. Dude, there\u2019s, like, a billion people in China. You wipeout on a scooter, you\u2019re gonna kill 80 not even trying. Fifty to 60 million, that\u2019s like steroid-era stats. Like, get the fuck out of here. What are you on? Come on. Am I supposed to believe that number? That\u2019s like when a second baseman had, like, 50 jacks. Dude, you had 20 in high school. Get the fuck out of here, 50 homeruns!"}
{"text": "I don\u2019t get it. I just don\u2019t get why\u2026 What I feel, whenever I do this bit, I always feel the crowd, you guys just don\u2019t like a sports analogy. You know? Let\u2019s go music, all right? It\u2019s Nashville. We\u2019ll look at it in a musical way. All right? Okay. Hitler drops an album. He sells six to nine million copies. All right? He\u2019s got a couple of summertime jams, maybe a prom song. He just catches a moment. He has his own dance, like \u201cGangnam Style,\u201d except it\u2019s got a little more with the hands. Right? It\u2019s more of an upper-body song. Then, later on that summer, Stalin drops his new shit. He sells 20-25 million copies. Twenty to 25 million copies is Michael Jackson Thriller, okay?

He\u2019s the next Hootie & The Blowfish!\u201d Right? You\u2019d smash him over the head with your fucking lantern, or whatever you\u2019ve got. Why don\u2019t his fucking kills count? Dude, Stalin, he even killed his own friends. Hitler didn\u2019t even do that. You go duck hunting with Stalin. You thought you were in with him. He\u2019s taking pictures with you and shit. It\u2019s all fucking good, right? Then, a week later, you parted your hair a little bit different, he got paranoid, and that was it, he whacked you. That\u2019s it. Not only that, he then had you erased out of the photo. You know? Next thing you know, Stalin\u2019s hugging a tree or some shit like that. This guy was photoshopping people out of photos\u2026 like, 60 years before the technology existed. He changed the fucking game! Yeah."}
{"text": "So, I watch a lot of the\u00a0YouTube\u00a0videos, right? So, the other night, my wife, lovely wife, she\u2019s falling asleep. I can\u2019t because I\u2019m all scatterbrained, so I just start watching YouTube clips. Okay? And I ended up seeing this clip of this lady down at the zoo. All right? This lady down at the zoo, who I\u2019m sure wasn\u2019t making as much money as the guy who worked at the zoo, and that\u2019s what needs to stop. Ladies, did you ever think of opening your own zoo? You know? Is there a reason you wait until we build the whole fucking thing, and then you show up when all the hard work is done? All the animals are captured. \u201cHey, where\u2019s my fucking corner office?!\u201d Yeah. Start your own fucking zoo! Go out and catch a cobra, see how that is. That\u2019s not the point of this story. I just like\u2026 I just like being a dick sometimes. So, this lady down at the zoo. This lady down at the zoo, she taught this\u00a0gorilla\u00a0how to do sign language. Okay? And I don\u2019t just mean like \u201chello\u201d and \u201cgoodbye.\u201d Like, literally phrases. This thing could, like, talk about its emotions. They were actually conversing. The gorilla is talking to her. \u201cOh, my God. You look upset.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m kind of sad.\u201d And they\u2019re just talking. So immediately, like, my brain just went fucking crazy. I was like, \u201cOh, my God. She\u2019s talking to a gorilla. I love gorillas. Who wouldn\u2019t talk to a gorilla?\u201d Without thinking that my wife is sleeping, I just blurted out, \u201cAsk it how much it can bench! Ask it how much it can bench!\u201d My wife pops up. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cLook at this! Look! She\u2019s talking to a gorilla!\u201d And we both just got sucked into this thing. Right? So, long story short, she\u2019s talking to this gorilla, and one day she decides to get it a little kitten. A little\u00a0kitty cat, right? Immediately I\u2019m thinking, like, \u201cDon\u2019t get it a cat! It\u2019s a gorilla.\u201d It\u2019s gonna twist the thing\u2019s head off, throw the body over there, play with the head for a while. Sniffing it and stuff. And then, later, it\u2019s gonna walk over and set the head down next to the body and wonder why the whole thing\u2019s not getting up again. Because it\u2019s a fucking gorilla. It\u2019s a wild animal. Wild animals don\u2019t have pets, right? It\u2019s kill or be killed out there. That\u2019s it. They don\u2019t have little parakeets on their shoulders and shit. But it was the exact opposite. She gives it this little kitten, and it immediately understood it was a baby, and this, like, parental thing came over. It was so, like, gentle and filled with joy. It was, like, beautiful, right? And then they understood that it loved this kitten, and they started using it as, like, a teaching tool, right? So every night they take the cat back, all right, and the next day they come in. If the gorilla learned its phrases, it got to play with the kitten. They use it as a motivational tool. So the gorilla\u2019s vocabulary started going through the roof. All right? So, to cut to the chase, one night they take the cat home. Somehow, the little kitten gets out. It got hit by car and it died. Yeah, that cat you never met died. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. I know you knew it, all of it, for fucking 20 seconds. You know? I don\u2019t know if it was dead instantly, like if it drove right over its head and that was it. Or maybe it just hit the back legs and it tried to crawl away, but it was\u2026 it was, like, stuck to the road, and it was\u2026 it was meowing out and it could see its breath. And right before it lost consciousness, the rats came in, and it was\u2026 it was just screaming, and in such\u2026 Cute little paws, it was like little socks, trying to get up."}
{"text": "I don\u2019t know what happened. But you seemed so fucking concerned about this kitten\u2026 I figured I\u2019d throw out a couple of theories. More concerned about the kitten than the Hitler shit, by the way. More of a reaction. More of a reaction. That\u2019s fine. Every crowd\u2019s a little bit different. That\u2019s not the point of the story. Okay? The point of the story\u2026 was now this lady had to go down to the zoo, she had to tell the gorilla that the kitten was dead, right? So she comes back down to the zoo, and the gorilla\u2019s all amped up. This is its favorite part of the day. Its mind is engaged and it sees its little friend. And at this point, its vocabulary is, like, crazy now. The lady shows up. The gorilla\u2019s all amped up. It looks at her like, \u201cOh, shit! What\u2019s up? Yeah!\u201d Right? Now, I can\u2019t do sign language, so you have to bear with me through the rest of this bit. I\u2019m gonna do the best I can, all right? So the thing\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Yeah!\u201d All right? But the zookeeper lady, she has, like, you know, just sitting there all sad, you know, trying to think how she\u2019s gonna tell it, and the gorilla picked up on the vibe. She\u2019s kind of like\u2026 \u201cHello.\u201d All of a sudden, the gorilla\u2019s energy comes down. She starts looking at the lady, like\u2026 \u201cWhat\u2019s uh\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d \u201cIs there something that I need to know? Huh?\u201d So the lady\u2019s sitting there, she\u2019s like, \u201cUh\u2026 Oh, Jesus. Uh\u2026\u201d \u201cWell\u2026 Well, the\u2026 the kitty cat\u2026 it got hit by a car\u2026 and it\u2019s fucking dead.\u201d And the gorilla immediately took it in. It immediately took it in. It understood. Like, its bottom lip started quivering, its eyes started watering up, it was signing \u201ccrying.\u201d And later on that night, you could hear it crying inside of its house. They built it a house. I don\u2019t know why. They live in trees. It was probably the guilt of putting the thing in fucking jail, right? Whatever. It was a two-bedroom. It sounded like it was in the kitchen. And you just hear this thing\u2026 in this house at night, just going\u2026 And that was the end of the video. That was the end of the video. And, like you, I was sitting there, like, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re gonna end on that?\u201d And then, literally, right in that moment, I felt my wife\u2019s head just rest on my shoulder, and she was like, \u201cThat was so sad. I mean, it was beautiful, but it was sad.\u201d And I was just like, \u201cGet off me.\u201d \u201cJust\u2026 Just get off me.\u201d And I closed the laptop, set it down on the nightstand, and I just got up, and I started pacing. As this fucking rage was coming up in me, my wife\u2019s, like, freaking out. She\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What is wrong with you?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 That video is fucked up!\u201d What is the purpose of that? You teach a gorilla how to talk, you\u2019re shootin\u2019 the shit, you get it a pet kitten and then it dies. And then the gorilla cries, and it\u2019s fucking sad, and then that\u2019s it? That\u2019s what you\u2019re leaving me with? I\u2019ve got to have that in my fucking head? How is that the end of the video? Somebody, for fuck\u2019s sake, tell me. Dude, that gorilla understood the concept of death. If it understands the concept of death, it understands its own captivity. Okay? So it never dawned on that lady, that whole time she\u2019s shootin\u2019 the shit with him, it never dawned on her to sign to the thing, like, \u201cHey.\u201d Like, \u201cDo you want to get the fuck out of here?\u201d \u201cDo you hate it in here? Do you want to fucking kill us\u2026 for sticking you in here, away from your friends in the jungle?\u201d And the thing would be like, \u201cYeah!\u201d \u201cYeah, please get me out. I beg of you! It fucking sucks in here!\u201d Right? And then you could have brainstormed, right? Like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna get you out of here.\u201d The only bad part would be you\u2019d have to deal with the gorilla and its crazy fucking gorilla idea. You know, like brainstorming its escape plan. The gorilla would be like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll get a bunch of bananas. We\u2019ll throw \u2019em and distract \u2019em, and then we\u2019ll climb out just using our arms.\u201d You literally just have to sit there, going, like, \u201cOkay. Okay. Uh\u2026 Not\u2026 Not trying to be a dick, but\u2026 I have a better idea. No, no, no. No disrespect to you. Okay?\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m gonna go to Big & Tall. I\u2019m gonna get a jacket, a hat, and some fucked-up-looking shoes. Okay? And what I need from you\u2026 What I need from you, okay\u2026 What I need from you is you\u2019ve got to lay off this shit. All right? No more of this. Okay? No, no disrespect. Okay? I need you\u2026 I need you to man up, all right? Stand up straight. Arm down. Stand up straight. Here\u2019s the difficult part, right here, okay? Left hand, right foot; right hand, left foot. You got it? Bam. Bam. All right? You get that shit down, I\u2019ll get you out of here in ten days. Cool? It\u2019s gonna be okay. Deal. Fuck! All right.\u201d \u201cSee you in ten days, right?\u201d So, like, the first day, the gorilla\u2019s sitting there, going, \u201cOkay. Okay.\u201d \u201cNo. No, no, no. No. No.\u201d \u201cOkay. Okay.\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cFuck!\u201d So that\u2019s the first day. That\u2019s day one, but the gorilla keeps working at it, right? Like, day two \u2013 day two it\u2019s kind of getting\u2026 Day three, day five, day seven, day nine, day ten. \u201cI\u2019m doing it! I\u2019m fucking doing it!\u201d Then she could have came back and broke that gorilla out of jail, right? Show up at night. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it!\u201d Put on the jacket, hat. \u201cCome on!\u201d You take him down to the car, the only way to get him back. You\u2019ve got to take it by car down to the harbor. That\u2019s the only way to get it back to the jungle. You can\u2019t go to the airport. You can\u2019t go to the airport, going through that fucking security. Right? Once he takes his shoes off and that thumb comes sticking out, it\u2019s fucking over! It\u2019s over. You keep it below deck. You keep the fucking thing below deck until you get out to international waters. Then you\u2019re fine. It\u2019s captain\u2019s law. \u201cCome aboard,\u201d right? And have the thing sit down. Other boats going by are looking at you, like, \u201cIs that a gorilla?\u201d \u201cYeah. What have you got, blood diamonds? Go fuck yourself!\u201d \u201cFucking sex slaves? Get out of here! I\u2019ll have him come aboard and rip that mask right off!\u201d And you\u2019re just hanging with the gorilla. You get to have that experience of seeing the thing free for the first time. As it comes over the horizon, it finally sees the jungle. It\u2019s getting all excited. It jumps off the boat, it\u2019s rolling in the sand. \u201cBuddy, we did it! Don\u2019t fuck up the coat, I\u2019ve got to bring it back. We did it! All right, I love you. I\u2019ll miss you. Get out of here before they see you.\u201d The thing runs right to the edge of the jungle and it just\u2026 disappears. \u201cIt did it. I knew it. He wanted to go see his friends, man. He wanted to be free. It\u2019s gonna be fucking great. He\u2019s gonna go meet his buddies, he\u2019s gonna talk to his friends now, like he should be, right? He\u2019s, uh\u2026 He\u2019s gonna go talk to his friends.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll\u2026 probably teach them how to talk.\u201d \u201cThen, of course\u2026 they\u2019ll probably get horses. Did I just start Planet of the fucking Apes? He\u2019s gonna teach his friends how to talk and get horses? Dude, I gotta kill this fucking thing! I gotta kill it. I fucked up. I gotta kill it. Sorry. Where\u2019s my Glock? Where the fuck is my Glock?! Where is it? It was right here! It was right here! Fuck!\u201d Got a little six shooter. \u201cFuck it, I\u2019ll take this.\u201d You run into the jungle, but it\u2019s a gorilla, so it\u2019s long gone. But you can\u2019t give up, man. All of society\u2019s gonna go down on you. You\u2019ve got to kill this thing. So you\u2019re just trudging through the jungle for months. You get six, seven months in, you\u2019ve got, like, malaria, you\u2019re about ready to give up. And out of nowhere, your buddy just jumps down, just like\u2026 \u201cOh, shit! What the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Then you just pull out your six shooter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, buddy. I gotta do it.\u201d The gorilla would be like, \u201cBut\u2026 I\u2026 I thought we were friends. Why?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, \u2019cause\u2026 \u2019cause Jesus wanted it that way, you know?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s this whole book. He made us in his image. We\u2019re just, you know\u2026 We\u2019re better than you, you know? Sorry, I can\u2019t have you talking to other chimps and then you tear down the Statue of Liberty.\u201d \u201cEveryone\u2019s gonna think I\u2019m an asshole. Look, I\u2019ll make it quick.\u201d And right as you go to pull the trigger, the gorilla pulls out that Glock you couldn\u2019t find. \u201cI just\u2026 I just want to know one thing. How did you know?\u201d \u201cYou knew before I knew.\u201d I don\u2019t have an ending for this. I don\u2019t. And in a weird way, now you know how I felt.. When I watched that video. You know what it was? You know what it was? I did that joke all around the country, all right, and the gorilla always died, \u2019cause Jesus wanted it that way\u2026 and that was it. And it fucking bombed in every goddamn city in this country except for Dallas, Texas. That was the only place where they got it. And I\u2019m not shitting on Texas. It bombed in Houston, Austin, El Paso, San Antonio. Killed in Dallas. They are the only ones who got it. They were like, \u201cHey, man, you did what you had to do. You did what you had to do, man.\u201d \u201cI mean, I loved that gorilla, too, but goddamnit, you cannot have two species working together. I tell you right now, you get a couple of gorillas on a bareback horse with a single bolt action rifle, that is the end of society as we know it.\u201d \u201cYou should get a hypothetical medal\u2026 for killing that gorilla, hypothetically.\u201d"}
{"text": "So\u2026 All right. I\u2019m gonna end with a quick little story here, okay? They\u2019re always talking about how to make a woman happy, but they don\u2019t do it enough to help you guys out\u00a0how to make a man happy. The great thing about men is we\u2019re fucking simple. We\u2019re fucking simple, okay? So here\u2019s the thing. You want to make a guy happy? If you\u2019re with a good guy, okay, this is all you\u2019ve got to do, okay? How about four times a year, once a season\u2026 you go out to the kitchen. Without him saying shit, you make a sandwich, you get him a beer, you walk out, you give it to him, you don\u2019t say a word, and you just fucking leave. That\u2019s all you\u2019ve got to do. Every three months, you do that, you\u2019ll keep him happy. That\u2019s all it takes. I know right out of the gate this is coming off sexist, because I\u2019m saying, \u201cGo out in the kitchen. Make your man a sandwich.\u201d I\u2019m not saying women belong in the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant, rubbing my balls. I\u2019m not saying that. Okay? I\u2019m just saying, women, go in the kitchen. Just go in the kitchen four times in a year, make a sandwich. A toddler could do that. Just put it together. Grab two slices of pre-made, pre-sliced bread, two handfuls of pre-murdered meat. Put a little mustard on it. Grab a beer, walk out, just hand it to him, don\u2019t say shit, and then fucking leave. When I say leave, I mean leave. I don\u2019t mean walk into another room for, like, ten minutes and then stick your head back and be like, \u201cDid you like it? Was it good? Great, because downstairs we need to\u2026 Don\u2019t yell at me! I just made you a sandwich!\u201d I don\u2019t mean that. I mean leave. Get in the car and fucking get out of here. Take the kids, drive down the street. Go see\u00a0Lord Of The Rings\u00a0a couple of times, and leave your man in the stunned silence of what you just did. If you ever want to see your guy get emotional, to see a man get emotional, you make him a fucking sandwich that he didn\u2019t ask for. I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s gonna have to dry the tears with the bread. He\u2019s gonna be so shocked, like\u2026 \u201cYou made this for me? And I didn\u2019t even ask. Oh, my God! I think she still gives a fuck!\u201d Yeah."}

She\u2019s scoping it out, because she\u2019s smart. She\u2019s finding the rooms that get sun, checking closet space. Me, like an idiot, I want to check out the garage. For whatever reason, I\u2019m drawn to this. And I go down, I open the door, and the last people hadn\u2019t cleaned it out. There was a busted refrigerator, an old file cabinet, an ab-roller, something from a luau. There were like seven failed businesses in this goddamn thing, and I gotta start lugging this shit out in, like, 90-degree weather, as a redhead, hating my life, right? I got three hours into this job, my forearms were cut, I had dirt, sweat, cobwebs all over me. I wanted to burn down this fucking house. I was ready to leave. But out of nowhere, my wife showed up, big smile on her face, and she had made me a sandwich. Cut it in half diagonally, which is love, right? If they don\u2019t cut it in half, they might as well frisbee it. \u201cHere you go, you fucking piece of shit. Hose yourself off! You should live out here! You should live out here!\u201d Right? Cut it in half diagonally, poured Fritos in the middle, and gave me an ice-cold beer. She did that five years ago. Do you know, to this day, every once in a while, I still think about that sandwich. It\u2019s unbelievable. It just pops in my head like this fond memory. I\u2019ll just be by myself, talking in the car. \u201cRemember that time she made me a sandwich? It was unbelievable! She cut it in half, Fritos, an ice-cold beer. I felt like a king!\u201d That\u2019s all it takes. You know what it felt like at that moment? You remember that movie\u00a0Shawshank Redemption? You know that scene where the prisoners are drinking the beer on the rooftop with the sun in their face? That\u2019s what it felt like. The only thing missing was Morgan Freeman\u2019s voice narrating over the top, \u201cAnd for 20 minutes, Bill Burr felt like a free man.\u201d"}
